# All About Trees

This project is to rebuild the
[_All About Trees_](https://denepo.js.org/agile-development/deliverables/all-about-trees/index.html)
site in a new repository as a group using the Planning and Collaborating
workflows. Many of the planning documents are already started in this folder.
Our group will use them as a starting point to plan our own rebuild of the site.

We _will not_ be planning a new website, and we _will not_ be trying to build
the most beautiful page possible. Our main focus should be the steps in
[Planning and Collaborating](https://github.com/DeNepo/planning-and-collaborating),
Git/GitHub workflows, and code review using a checklist.
